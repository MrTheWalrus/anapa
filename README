An ongoing experiment with Ember.js and Arbor.js.

Use the list to add and remove nodes from the graph. Newly created nodes will be attached to any that are checked (green) at time of creation.

Stuff to do next time:
Create existing nodes on page reload
Make Model automatically trigger a canvas redraw on change
Attach full model as data element on graph nodes
Node style based on model properties
Label nodes with names
Autoupdate names
